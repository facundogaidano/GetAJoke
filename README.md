# GetAJoke
To run "Get a Joke" you need to `npm i` and then `npm run dev` to start the server. It'll be hosted on port 3000.

The CSS Style is NOT MINE. It's from a previous project, I've plans to change it and make it more like my styles (watch for my latest repos)

My main goal of this project was to be able to use a Public API, I've been thinking on making a Weather APP using OpenWeatherAPI and another API to get "Lat & Lon" from that selected city. It wasn't posible to make due to OpenWeather took their time to validate my API_KEY so I made this (more easy than the WeatherAPP) instead :)
